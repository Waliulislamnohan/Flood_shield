# FloodShield
Bangladesh, as a downstream community, faces frequent and severe floods that impact thousands of lives every year. We at MonsoonFive are proud to present FloodShield, a tool designed to predict upcoming floods, provide real-time updates on rising water levels, and offer detailed flood maps. Our admin dashboard allows researchers to contribute flood forecasting data. FloodShield integrates satellite data from NASA's MODIS and Landsat, along with real-time information from the BWDB (Bangladesh Water Development Board). The best part? All information from FloodShield is free and publicly available, ensuring data transparency and accessibility for everyone, empowering communities to make informed decisions and act quickly during critical times.

# Project Details
### What is it?
FloodShield addresses the critical challenge of community mapping in flood-prone areas. By creating an innovative flood prediction and alert system, we harness NASA's open-source historical flood data to empower communities. Our platform visualizes real-time water levels across Bangladesh through an interactive map, highlighting recent, danger, and peak water levels from various stations. With the ability to predict floods up to 15 days in advance, FloodShield gives people the time they need to take action. The system also includes a chatbot for personalized flood predictions and an admin panel for researchers to upload data, promoting transparency and informed decision-making.

### Why this is relevant or important?
FloodShield tackles the urgent global challenge of rising flood frequency and severity driven by climate change. With millions of lives disrupted annually, our project provides a critical solution to enhance community resilience and preparedness. By leveraging NASA's open-source historical datasets, FloodShield empowers communities to anticipate flooding events and take preventive measures, ultimately saving lives and reducing economic losses.
